## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Hyungwoo Jo**, a researcher with deep interests in **psychiatry** and **statistics**. Through this blog, I share insights and practical applications in:

- **Causal Inference** - Understanding cause-and-effect relationships in medical research
- **Statistical Methods** - Exploring advanced statistical techniques and their applications  
- **R Programming** - Demonstrating statistical computing solutions with R

### What You'll Find Here

My posts focus on bridging the gap between statistical theory and practical implementation, particularly in the context of medical and psychiatric research. I aim to make complex statistical concepts accessible while maintaining methodological rigor.

### Background

I'm passionate about applying rigorous statistical methods to understand complex phenomena in psychiatry and medicine. My work involves exploring causal relationships, handling competing risks, and developing robust analytical approaches for real-world data challenges.
